# ATM-Machine

This C++ code creates a simple ATM simulation using a class called ATM. The class manages a balance and provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. The main() function initializes an ATM object, deposits $1000, checks the balance, withdraws $500 (if sufficient funds are available), and then displays the final balance.
